# MIDTERM 
My midterm project consisted of the following components: a potentiometer, three jumper wires and an arduino board. My project is based the portal that Rick and Morty travel in the show. The most challenging thing about my project was getting my code to run in processing. I chose this project because I like the portals and also Rick and Morty. Moreover, I thought it would be a cool make emulate portal.
